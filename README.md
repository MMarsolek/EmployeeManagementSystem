# Employee Management System 

![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description
This terminal based system uses MySql2 to store data pertaining to your company. It is currently set up to track employee data, department data, and role data. It also has functionality built in that allows you to add or update employees, roles, and departments.

## Tests
To test the functionality, run source schema.sql and source seeds.sql in MySql first to ensure the databases are created and seeded with fake data for you to test on.

## How to use
Make sure you run source schema.sql in mysql prior to running this program inorder to create the databases. I have also included my seed documents so you can seed the databases to test some of the functionality.
